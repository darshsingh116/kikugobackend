That's a good start!  The sentence "水を１本買います。" means "I will buy one bottle of water."  You correctly translated the core part, but the sentence is more precise.  The addition of "１本" (ippon) is crucial.

Good job!  Let's move on to the next sentence.

ごはんを    注文してください。


(your answer here)
The sentence "水を１本買います。"  means "I will buy one bottle of water."

Let's break it down:

* **水を (mizu o):**  Water (みず)  +  object marker (を)
* **１本 (ippon):** One bottle (or one piece)
* **買います (kaimasu):** Buy (かう) +  present-tense form of the verb (verb-ending indicating you're going to buy it).

So, the whole sentence conveys the complete action and shows that you want to purchase one bottle of water.  It's a clear and concise way to express the intent.

Scenario: You are at a convenience store.  You want to buy a bottle of water.

Items:  water (mizu), bottle (bottoru), buy (kaimono suru)

Your sentence:  mizu no bottoru o kaimono shimasu.


Please read and translate the sentence.  I will help if you need it.
Your translation is good, but in Japanese, we would usually say something like "mizu no bottoru o kaitai desu" or "mizu no bottoru o kaimono shimasu."  The first one is more natural for expressing a desire, and the second one is more about the action of buying.  

The sentence "mizu no bottoru o kaimono shimasu."  means "I want to buy a bottle of water."  Is this what you'd like to say?
